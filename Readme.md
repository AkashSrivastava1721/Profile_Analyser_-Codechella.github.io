## Project Explanation (Problem and Solution)
**Problem Statement**

Everyone wants to see certain kinds of tweets on their dashboard, for example, Motivational or Technical. Finding out and following those kinds of handles is a tedious task as Twitter Bio can be abstract and deceiving at times. We have to find a way to quickly have an idea about what kind of content is generally tweeted by a handle so that all users, especially visually impaired users can save their time of manually analyzing a profile by going through all the tweets one by one.

**Solution**

We can deploy a new feature to Twitter, called Profile Analyzer. It will scan the tweets posted on any handle and give a brief report, which will include:

1. Badge: To show how actively the user tweets.
2. Analysis Report: Graphs and Charts showing the percentage of tweets based on different categories.
3. Top Tweets: Most popular tweets of all the categories.
4. Sentiments: To know the user mindset if it is Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
5. Tags: To tag each user profile by the most common category of his tweet.
6. Summary: A summary of the complete analysis report with an immersive reader for ease of access to visually impaired users.
